<h2>Cromite Youtube Shorts Block List</h1>
<p><h4>If you are tired of seeing shorts in searches and filter lists that you tried are only for ublock origin, which doesnt work on Cromite, then you are on the right place. Just add the raw url to your custom filter lists and restart Cromite or disable and re-enable ABP.</h3></p>

<h4>Note: this hides shorts and disables the option to play them, the button is still there.</h4>
